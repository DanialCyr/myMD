Happy and joyful, carrying my camera and notepad, I set off to film my one-minute-Beijing video.

Walking through ancient sites and relics, I learned about old-Beijing folklores : In a sugar figurine shop in the summer palace, I found out the ancient history behind this near-extinct craft. I began to take an intense interest in this assignment. To match my dialogue in the video about technology and traffic, I went to subways and sky bridges voluntarily to film these shots.

During the filming, I caught a glimpse of the ancient folklore and traditions hidden in the alleyways in Beijing. With the most ancient of history,it's formal imperial glory,and the most valuable of technologies, Beijing is truly the biggest metropolis ever.
