The quality that I desire yet not possess at the moment is hardworking. It means: constantly, regularly, or habitually engaged in earnest and energetic work.

Hardworking is important when you are trying to accomplish a big goal. In fact, it is essential. I once read a story. Alex Hannold is a professional climber, he likes free soloing: climbing without the use of ropes, best. like a lot of climbers, he has a goal to climb a mountain called El Capitan. It's nearly 1000 inches in height, and as steep as a vertical wall, with not a lot of crevices to cling to. In order to accomplish this goal. He practiced reapeatedly for over 8 years. In one part of the course, he have to cling to a small rock protruding from the mountain, and mean while using his momentum to swing his leg in an arc to kick at the opposite side of the wall. this part he practiced for about 4 years. Without hardworking, he cannot success.

on the other hand, I lack hardworking. sometimes, when an obstical came across that is too great for me to accomplish, I usually quit. 

so the quality I greatly desire yet do not possess is hard working.
