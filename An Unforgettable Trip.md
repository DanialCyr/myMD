# An Unforgettable Trip

I went on my most unforgettable trip about a 3 years ago, during my first time to The United States.

 Our plane dropped down on the tarmac of the Los Angeles Airport at about 6 am. I was still groggy from watching movies for 12 hours straight, but even so I soon became wide awake. There's so much to see! From the hotdog stands carelessly positioned in the street, to the motorcycles roaming freely and "dominating the road", America gives out a completely different vibe from China. Whereas China is all about rules and laws, America has a more carefree lifestyle. For a brief second, I felt like HP when he first visited Diagon Alley, trying to see everything at once and in need of several more eyes.
