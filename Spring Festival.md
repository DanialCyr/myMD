# Spring Festival

Spring Festival customs: Our country has a long history of Spring Festivals, and some relatively fixed customs have been formed during the years. Many of them are still passed down to this day, such as handling New Year's goods, sweeping dust on tombs, sticking to the New Year's Day(countdown to new year), reunion dinner, New Year's greetings, Dragon and lion dances, worship to gods and ancestors, firecrackers and fireworks(to scare away the Nian monster), pray for blessings, go to temple fairs, and other customs. Like Christmas in Western countries, Chinese New Year is a time to be home with family, chatting, drinking, cooking, and enjoying a hearty meal together. Traditional festival rituals and related custom activities are important content of festival elements, and is one of the most marvelous of China's spiritual treasures.
