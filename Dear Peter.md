Dear Peter,

How is it going? There's an event upcoming in our school called "Inhering the Red Spirit, remembering our mission", in which we'll learn about the deeds of the martyrs and party members that helped shape our glorious Communist Party. Hope you can come.

If you are to attend, you're expected to be at the school gate 8:00 sharp in the morning this Saturday for our bus. We'll travel to the Museum of the Communist Party of China. Some appropriate items you should be bringing include: notepad &pen, your own lunch, and camera.

I highly recommend you to join us for this trip because I know how much you love research and museums, the the museum of the CPC will be a perfect place to use your researching skills. We'll be divided into groups to study each different eras during the communist party, the  founding, the siege with The Chinese Nationalist Party, the great march, and the war with Japan, to be precise. After than, we'll watch some educational film regarding how the communist party is founded and the sacrifices the founding fathers made for the future of China. And lastly, before we leave, we will visit the souvenir shop make some small purchases. I'm sure our trip will be very interesting, hope you can join us.

I'm looking forward to your early reply,

with all due respect,

Li Hua
