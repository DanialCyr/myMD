# My Friend and Me

Friendship is one of the greatest blessings that not everyone is lucky enough to have. We meet a lot of people in the journey of life but there are only a few who leave a mark on us. My best friend, myj, is one such person who has been able to make a positive impact on my life.

We were similar in almost every way. We share contempt for the same teacher, have the same taste in music, and even share an interest in the same sports. We spend all our time together laughing at secret jokes, talking about favorite sports stars, and helping each other with our studies. 

Despite our similarities, there are still some differences to set us apart. He's remarkably fat while I'm quite slim. I like to read, while he reads approximately 14 pages a week. He's always considerate of others while I'm famous for making enemies wherever I go.

As to the true meaning of friendship, I'm not sure. To use the famous boxer Muhammad Ali's word: "Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. But if you haven't learned the meaning of it, you really haven't learned anything." I believe the meaning of friendship is only this: that you consider the other person's well-being to be as valuable as your own.

In short, the bond I share with my best friend is one of my most prized possessions. As the saying goes:" One who finds a best friend, finds a priceless gem."  A best friend is indeed a precious gem and I am fortunate to have found that gem of my life.
