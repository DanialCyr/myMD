# The Immortality Paradox

Human beings have a rather basic life cycle: they are born, they learn, they labor, they die. Suppose, for a moment, that a person did not have to die. What would be the consequences? Would immortality be a blessing or a curse?

Immortality might be the most awful curse ever. Imagine watching those you love growing old around you while you remain healthy and young. How could a person have attachment to another human being all the while knowing that the two of them will one day have to say goodbye, forever. 

And if immortality is gifted to everyone on Earth, so you're spared of saying goodbye to everyone you love, the consequences would be more serious still. Each day, approximately 15000 people die, and 35000 people are born. With people already being born three times faster than they can die, imagine if nobody died. Our population would increase by astronomical numbers. This would lead to overpopulation and the only solution might be "the hunger game"(no offense).

One might look at the lighter side of immortality: there would be no more wars, because there would be no one to kill. But that's not to be. War was fought because of greed and envy, and lust is human nature. So war would still be fought even though where would be no casualties. But the odds of a person getting seriously injured would still be present, and the person who might have originally died might have to live the rest of their never ending lives in terrible pain.

In conclusion, though death may cause sorrow and misery, the alternative is a much more unpleasant option.
