The Olympic games are particularly important because we put our differences aside during these games, every country can focus on their people, the number of medals won and of course, their pride. Another highlight of the Olympics is seeing all the represented countries walk proudly with their flags raised through the arena.  In the Olympic games, the whole world comes together and celebrates our athletes, no matter how many people are represented per nation. Lastly, the Olympics is a time to appreciate the history of our past athletes as well as celebrate our up and coming powerhouse athletes.  

There has been seemingly universal enthusiasm among athletes to be a part of Beijing 2022 winter olympic.
