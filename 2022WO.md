On the 18th of October, 2021, the torch containing the sacred olympic fire is relayed from Greece to Beijing. Officially marking it as the hosting place of the 2022 winter olympics.

For the upcoming winter olympic, beijing has made many preparations. Three main zones are constructed to deploy the venues that will be used in the upcoming games. The Beijing zone will be hosting the opening and closing ceremony of the Olympic games. In addition, the events of curling, ice hockey, snowboarding, and speed and figure skating will also be held here. Penultimately, Luge, bobsleigh, and alphine skating will be held in the Yanqing zone, which hosts the national Alphine skiing centre and the national sliding centre. All other skiing events and biathlon will be held in the Zhangjiakou zone, which is home to the famous national ski jumping centre. 

The Olympic games are particularly important because we put our differences aside during these games, every country can focus on their people, the number of medals won and of course, their pride. In the Olympic games, the whole world comes together and celebrates our athletes.

With seemingly universal ensusiasm from athletes around the world, the 2022 Beijing Olympics is truly sticking to it's motto of "together for a shared future"
