On September 8, 1943, Werner Best, the German general in Denmark, sent a telegram to Adolf Hitler to propose that the Germans use the martial law to arrest the Danish Jews. Hitler approved it nine days later. But before the final order came to Copenhagen, words leaked out and the local Jewish community was alerted. Danish authorities, Jewish leaders, and countless citizens started a massive operation to get Jews into hiding. The Jews will be ferried across the narrow sea by fishermen to Sweden, a safe haven for Jews at the time. But before they are ferried, they were hidden in all kinds of places along the Danish coast like hospitals and churches(or in other people 's houses like in NTS). These relocation places were special because it was nationwide and actually ran by Danish officials. Denmark was the only country to stand up for its Jewish citizens.
