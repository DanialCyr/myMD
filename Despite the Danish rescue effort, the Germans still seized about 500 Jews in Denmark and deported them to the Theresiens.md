Despite the Danish rescue effort, the Germans still seized about 500 Jews in Denmark and deported them to the Theresienstadt ghetto in Czechoslovakia. Therefore, we can conclude that if all the Jews were captured in Denmark, they might've met a similar fate. The Theresienstadt ghetto serves three purposes: 1. a temporary holding pen tell the Jews were deported to killing camps. 2. a labor camp for Jews. And 3. a lab for evil science experiment that I don't want to elaborate on. The Theresienstadt ghetto also serves as a tool for propaganda,  The publicly stated purpose for the deportation of the Jews was their "resettlement to the east," while the ghetto was in reality really a collection center for deportations to killing centers.
