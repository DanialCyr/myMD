Dear Ms. Su:

Because of the sheer enormity of this essay, it's too bothersome to write by hand. So I have print out the computerized version, but I promise the content will be very entertaining still, I hope you can understand : )

With all due respect,

##### The Main Storyline of The Da Vinci Code

As not to spoil this amazing book, I would only tell the main storyline vaguely.

Robert Langdon is in Paris to give a lecture on his work. Having made an appointment to meet with Jacques Saunière, the curator of the Louvre, he is startled to find the French police at his hotel room door. They inform him that Saunière has been murdered and they would like his immediate assistance at the Louvre to help them solve the crime. Unknown to Langdon, he is in fact the prime suspect in the murder and has been summoned to the scene of the crime so that the police may extract a confession from him. While he is in the Louvre, he meets Sophie Neveu, a young cryptologist from the French Judicial Police. When Langdon and Sophie get the chance to talk in private, he finds out that Jacques Saunière is her grandfather. Saunière instructs Sophie to 'find Robert Langdon', according to the message he left for her on the floor. Hence, Sophie believes he is innocent of her grandfather's murder.
He spends the rest of the novel dodging the police and trying to solve the mystery of an ancient secret society, the Priory of Sion, which was once headed by Leonardo da Vinci. At the end of the novel, Langdon uncovers the mystery behind Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail.

##### The Cultural Background Story In The Da Vinci Code

This book is actually mainly about the struggle between the Christian Kingdom and the Prieuré de Sion. As the Bible states, Jesus and Mary Magdalene were companions, but never got married, nor had any children. It also says that Eve was made from Adam's rib. Since then, Christians have built the belief that men were greater than women, and the ancient belief that feminine is devine was lost. But the Prieuré de Sion, an ancient organization reinforces the belief that feminine is holy and should be treated as much, and also Mary Magdalene and Jesus does have one daughter: Sarah,  they protected them as they live in secrecy, and have protected the two main branch of the descendants of Jesus --- the families with the surnames Saint-Clair and Plantard. They also wrote some documents which they dubbed "Grail Documents", and have protected them ever since. The two mighty organizations clashed violently and result in many phenomenal  influences with the human history. For example, the knights templar(who were slaughtered mercilessly by the church) is actually Priory members in disguise, trying to transfer the ancient grail documents and Mary Magdalene's bones to a safe location.

So, in reality, the Holy Grail is not the cup which Jesus used in the last supper and can grant immortality, it's really just the chance to see the "Grail Documents"; and the so called "Grail Quest" that has killed so many knights in the middle ages, is just a journey to kneel before the bones of the holy bones of Mary Magdalene. 

In the end of the book, the Holy Grail is never really revailed to the world, and remained buried, but I think that is for the best. As to quote the Da Vinci code:

*It is the mystery and wonderment that serves our souls, not the Grail itself. The beauty of the Grail lies in her ethereal nature. For some, the Grail is a chalice that will bring them everlasting life. For others, it is the quest for lost documents and secret history. And for most, I suspect the Holy Grail is simply a grand idea... A glorious unattainable treasure that somehow, even in today's world of chaos, inspires us.*

##### The Morals In The Da Vinci Code

Since the main theme of this book is Christianity, the main moral, inevitably, is one of faith.

Some say that Faith in God is rooted in ignorance of the truth, and there's a validation for that. The ignorance that the Church has sometimes advocated is embodied in the character of Bishop Aringarosa, who does not think the Church should be involved in a scientific investigation. According to The Da Vinci Code, the Church has also enforced ignorance about the existence of the descendants of Jesus. 

Yet, Faith, is a good thing. It isn’t just a notion that some people hold onto in tough times; faith is an important element to all human life on earth. Life is precious, but it can also be remarkably difficult at times. Faith is what helps to get us through, illuminating the pathway in times of darkness, helping to give us strength in times of weakness. Without faith, we are nothing.

It was Faith that helped Silas to redeem himself, to recognize the nature of his sins, and be reborn, it was faith that helped countless Christians across the world to lead better life. *Hebrews 11:1 said: Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.*

In the novel, Robert Langdon thinks that people who truly believe in God will be able to accept the idea that the Bible is full of metaphors, not literal transcripts of the truth. People’s faith, in other words, can withstand the truth.

Just like Bishop Aringarosa says:"*Sometimes a little Faith can do wonders.*"

##### The Analysis of Symbolism in The Da Vinci Code

There's many symbolisms in the Da Vinci Code, but I will only tell of one that fascinates me the most.

We're all familiar with the symbol for male: ♂, and female: ♀. But there's a more ancient symbol that's far more simpler, it's called the blade(△), and the Chalice(▽). While Christianity thrives to build a world where men is more powerful than its female counterpart, the Prieuré de Sion reinforces the belief that woman is equal to men. That is why, as the symbol of the Prieuré de Sion priests (later adopted by the Israelite Kings David and Solomon and now represents the Jews), The Star of David(✡️ ), is actually just the Blade and the Chalice, fused as one, symbolizing equality and fertility of both men and women.
