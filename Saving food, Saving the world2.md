### Saving Food, Saving the World

初中组  李昌璟

I recently read an interesting story. Rob Greenfield is an environmental activist from America. He did research on how much food is wasted in the United States in a way that grossed me out: by "dumpster diving". 

He went to each major city in the United States and visited the dumpsters to find if there was edible food inside. The results are stunning: he found enough perfectly good food for hundreds of families each time, and even though it was from the dumpsters, people keep going up to him and say: "Hey, can I eat this food?", which only shows how big of a problem food waste is.

 Food waste is happening all around us. Every day at lunchtime, I see students dump dish after dish into the bin.

The consequences of food waste on the environment are equally massive. Food discarded not only wastes the food itself, but also the resources that helped it to grow and be delivered to your table, including water, labor, fuel, money, and so on. Wastes been thrown back into the ocean are also having a huge impact on sea life and their natural balance.

With millions of people been underfed around the world and the environment as delicate as it is already, we should make the most of the food we have.

Food wasting is causing catastrophe around the world. But there is something that we can do about it. First of all, when eating, you should only take what you can eat, and if it is not enough, add more afterward. Additionally, don't overeat, especially fast food as it contains much more sugar and fat than normal food.

If we can stop wasting food, we can possibly end world hunger and make the environment better.  Just imagine how great that would be! Saving food, saving the world!
