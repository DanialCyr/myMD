Where I live is one of the greatest neighborhoods in Beijing to live in. The Furongli community has nearly everything a student resident might want, beautiful scenery, convenient access to school, and many sports centers.
There is a large park occupying the edge of my neighborhood. This park also happens to be my favorite place. My neighborhood is flooded with kids around my age to hang out with. And every day we would most likely kill our time in the park. The grass fields dotting around the park is magnificent. With the possible drawback of animal droppings aside, it is perfect for playing soccer and riding bicycles alike. The park is between my home and school, you only need to cross Furongli Street to get to it.
In retrospect, my neighborhood does have its drawbacks. The roads can be hard to navigate and there's not a lot of supermarkets nearby. But it's the base of all of my dreams and wildest fantasies, and I love it all the same.
