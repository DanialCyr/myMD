### Saving Food, Saving the World

I recently read an interesting story. **p **Rob Greenfield is an environmental activist from America. He did research on how much food is wasted in the United States in a way that grossed me out: frankly, **p **by "dumpster diving". **p**

He went to major cities in the United States and visited the dumpsters to find if there was edible food inside. The results were stunning **p**: he found enough perfectly good food for hundreds of families each time,**p** and even though it was from the dumpsters, people kept going up to him and said **p**: "Hey, can I eat this food?", which only shows how big of a problem food waste is. **lp**

Food wasting is happening all around us. Every day at lunch time, I see students dump ***dish after dish*** into the bin. **p**

Wasting food in such manner is equally as bad as wasting the resources it needs to be produced. Also, when food is disposed in a landfill ***it rots and becomes a significant source of methane*** â€“ **p** a potent greenhouse gas with ***twenty-one times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide***. **p**

With millions of people been underfed around the world and the environment as delicate as it is already **p**, we should make the most of the food we have. **lp**

Another huge problem we now face is overeating. **p** We spend our lives being paranoid about ***death and murder***, while diseases caused by overeating(including ***hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke)*** causes death about sixty percent more. The extra calories you consume not only are bad for your health **p** but are also wasting resources and creating environmental problems. For example, the extra burger you eat will waste ***approximately 1,800 gallons of water.*** 

Both of these problems are causing catastrophes around the world. But there is something that we can do about it. **p **First of all, when eating, you should only take what you can eat, and if that is not enough, help yourself to more afterwards. **p** Additionally, don't overeat, especially fast food as it contains much more ***fat and sugar*** than normal food. **lp**

If we can stop these twin problems, **p **that is,b **p** food wasting and overeating, we can possibly end world hunger and make the environment better. ***Just imagine how great that would be!*** ***Saving food, p saving the world!***
