One year back, King Aerys decides to demand heavier taxation to replenish the King's vault. However, this caused several houses to complain. Especially House Rosby and Darklyn, occupying the port cities Rosby and Duskendale as their seat of power, they have already seen their wealth shrink and trade dwindle due to the growth of nearby King's landing. 

The Tullys and the Arryns both resented the heavy taxation too, due to their abundance of fertile lands, they have to pay taxes three times more than before. They 

Then came the event which will later be known as "The Defiance of Duskendale."  Lord Denys Darklyn wishes to win a charter for Duskendale, so it can collect its taxes and have special treatment for some of its citizens. This offer was denied by the King's Hand, Lord Tywin Lannister. Sensing the tense relationship between King Aerys and his Hand, Lord Darklyn invited Aerys to come himself to hear out his petition. Eager to demonstrate his ability to handle the situation without the help of his Hand, Aerys decided to settle the issue personally and bring the defiant Lord Darklyn to heel, not knowing Lord Darklyn has some more defiant plans.

As far as Aerion is concerned, he is of Darklyn heritage, and Lord Denys's nephew. His parents died in the fifth Blackfyre rebellion, so he is being watched over by his uncle and attend as his squire. Been trained in swordsmanship since he was five, he has mastered every technique. During the "Defiance of Duskendale," he slew Kingsguard Gwayne Gaunt and helps captures King Aerys.

Lord Darklyn, knowing the Tullys and the Arryns's resentment, allianced the four Houses Tully, Arryn, Rosby, and Darklyn.
