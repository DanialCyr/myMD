# HP_Essay_2 - Analysis on the Houses

## 1. *Slytherin* - The House of The Serpent

```
"Or perhaps in Slytherin,

 You'll find your real friends.
 
 Those cunning folk use any means,
 
 To achieve their ends."
 
 ----- The Sorting Hat [1]
```

### 1.1. Cunningness

Cunning is oft regarded as a bad thing by most. There were many moments when we noticed Draco Malfoy was almost always able to get what he wanted, even if this seemed quite unfair.

Some people would call that cheating, but that only shows you have a different perspective. Slytherins are known to bend the rules in their favor or even create new ones when necessary, one of the primary reason that Harry Potter was nearly sorted into Slytherin was because of this trait.

In reality, Slytherin isn't so different from their Gryffindor counterparts, except that their motives often seem more selfish to some. Regardless, knowing how to get what you want is a valuable skill and it's not something taught at any school. All the magic in the world can't give you a Slytherin's cunningness.

### 1.2 Ambition

One of the core pillars that supports and defines a Slytherin is their ambition. There were many times in the series where the main characters renounced personal achievements in favor of group effort. While that’s not a bad thing, there’s also nothing wrong with Slytherin’s preference for ambition and excellence.

This is further backed by the fact that Slytherin has the most powerful (although dark) witches and wizards of all time. There’s a reason why the Death Eaters usually won over the Order of the Phoenix, and that’s because Slytherins tended to be a class above other wizards. The House’s track record speaks for itself, with the likes of Merlin, Voldemort, Severus Snape, Bellatrix Lestrange, Antonin Dolohov, Horace Slughorn all hailing from Slytherin.

In comparison, only Gryffindor comes close to Slytherin in this regard, but even then most of the characters, like Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Professor McGonagall, had lost to the aforementioned Slytherins.**[2]**

### 1.3 Loyalty

```
"The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties."
-----Minerva McGonagall [3]
```

In the battle of Hogwarts all of the Slytherin students abandoned the school, leaving only the Gryffindors, many Ravenclaws and a handful of Hufflepuffs to defend it. Yet only by that, it's not accurate to deem that Slytherins aren’t loyal. The truth is that Slytherins show their loyalties only to those they are completely attached to, meaning their friends and family.

The Malfoys are the greatest proof of this, as they abandoned their Death Eater ways to survive the Battle of Hogwarts by staying together. Even Bellatrix Lestrange was fully devoted to Voldemort due to her love for him.

----------------------------------

Many Slytherins are deemed to be "evil and souless" just because they were sorted into Slytherin. Facing these prejudices, this is a partial reason many of them actually turned evil, because the world treated them as much. 

And yet, Slytherins, with their unique combination of cunningness and ambition, is capable of producing many great feats; and with their well-chosen-loyalty, they will avoid the possibility that they will be betrayed by others. This will become the reason why Slytherin is the best house of all.

## 2. *Gryffindor* - The House of The Lion

```
"You might belong in Gryffindor,

  Where dwell the brave at heart.

  Their daring, nerve, and chivalry,

  Set Gryffindors apart."
  
  -----The Sorting Hat [4]
```

---------------------

### 2.1. Bravery

```
"By Gryffindor, the bravest were prized far beyond the rest."
----- J.K. Rowling [5]
```

While the idea of bravery doesn’t exactly seem like an overly important thing to have when at school and your main focus is getting good grades, it does have its benefits when... oh I don’t know... taking part in the largest wizarding war of all time *smirk. The bravery of many Gryffindors, from Harry to Neville, was probably one of the main reasons that good was able to triumph evil at the end of The Deathly Hallows.

### 2.2. Why I *despise* it

* **Too Spoiled**

  Gryffindors are absolutely the most coddled house. While Snape might favor Slytherins, he is the only one, and basically everyone else gives Gryffindors a pass. More than once they get rewarded where other houses would get punished, or they get rewarded just for the sake of it, or they get rewarded for things they absolutely do not deserve.

* **Short-sightedness**

  Gryffindors might sneer at Slytherins for being narrow-minded, but in truth, many Gryffindors are plagued with attitude issues of their own, they're just not made to examine them. Ron, for instance, while defending muggles and muggle-borns, refuses to allow that House Elves need to be granted greater equality. **[6]**

* **They endanger others**

  Gryffindors oft think they see the greater good, but often, they lead those around them into greater trouble.

  Over and over again, Harry's missions lead his classmates and friends into great danger. Gryffindors also don't see any issue with pranks that go too far (Fred and George Weasley is a a great example) which leads to great upset.

  

## 3. *Ravenclaw* - The house of The Raven

```
"Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,

  If you've a ready mind.

  Where those of wit and learning,

  Will always find their kind."
  
  -----The Sorting Hat [7]
```

### 3.1. Wisdom and Intelligence

One of the prime traits required to be sorted into Ravenclaw house is intelligence. Ravenclaw wants its students to excel at their studies, and to be honest since schooling plays a big part in the success of all the houses, this makes a lot of sense.

The house had many very clever students, meaning they were able to think their way out of a lot of situations.

It also values and promotes unconventionality and thinking outside the box. See Luna’s answer to the riddle “Which came first, the phoenix or the flame?” She said “A circle has no beginning,” instead of just choosing one of the two possible answers.

### 3.2. Respct for Diversity

If you're an outsider, this can most-definitely be your house: Ravenclaws respect individuality and diversity, and not in the Hufflepuff way (just because they’re “kind”). Ravenclaws think that being unique is very interesting and like forming relations with people who have unusual talents.

This can further be proved by the universally loved chracter Luna Lovegood: she's quirky and eccentric, yet is accepted by Ravenclaw students without any difficulty. She also formed a bond with The Trio, and played a big part in shaping the storyline of the complete series.

### 3.3. Cool Commonroom

```
"At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird's call, a soft, musical voice said, 'which came first, the phoenix or the flame?'"

Luna: "I think the answer is that a circle has no beginning."

"Well reasoned," said the voice, and the door swung open.[8]
```

The entry into the Ravenclaw common room is really interesting, with their painting demanding that the student answer a riddle each time. This forces them to show off the intellect that landed them in the house in the first place, although it probably gets quite time consuming eventually.

### plus, blue is my favorite color XD

## 4. *Hufflepuff* - The house of The Badger

```
"You might belong in Hufflepuff,

 Where they are just and loyal.
 
 Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,
 
 And unafraid of toil."
 
 ----- The Sorting Hat [9]
```

### 4.1. Acceptance

Thanks to the kindness and acceptance of Hogwarts founder Helga Hufflepuff, this house is famous for accepting everyone.

Compared to Salazar Slytherin’s pure-bloods-only thinking, Helga’s house is a accepting for wizards and witches with any blood status and background. And for this wonderful reason, Hufflepuff should be applauded.

### 4.2. Wizards (and witches) production

Hufflepuff produces many talented wizards, and also the least amount of dark wizards in the four houses (in fact, according to my research, there's none.). Great wizards including Triwizard Champion Cedric Diggory to talented magizoologists like Newt Scamander to the punk-styled Auror Nymphadora Tonks all helped shaped the Harry Potter universe in delicate details both big and small.**[10]**
