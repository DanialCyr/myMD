I think it’s fair to say that few books have ever inspired as much controversy as J.K. Rowling’s hugely popular “Harry Potter” fantasy series. With more than 400 million copies sold, the books have impacted popular culture in a massive way. And, of course, they’ve attracted praise and scorn from virtually all sides, including an almost unprecedented amount of criticism from the Christian community.

## SUMMARY:

(Note: In order to evaluate the complex themes of this series, the following commentary contains spoilers)

The “Harry Potter” series is the story of the eponymous hero, orphaned at birth and left in the care of the cruel Dursley family of “Muggles” . On his eleventh birthday, Harry receives a letter from Hogwarts, a school for young wizards and witches, and promptly enters a world of wonder and mystery. At Hogwarts, he meets his two closest friends – Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger – and begins studying magic. It soon becomes clear that the death of Harry’s parents was no accident: the evil Dark Lord Voldemort murdered them. Voldemort also attempted to kill Harry, but his attack rebounded on himself, severely crippling Voldemort’s power. The first few books of the series develop the characters and set the stage for Book 4, in which Voldemort returns to power and regains a physical form. Aided by his fellow evil wizards (“Death Eaters”), Voldemort begins a campaign to kill Harry Potter, the only one who may stand a chance of defeating him. The last three volumes deal with Harry’s increasingly desperate battle against Voldemort, and his fight to remain steadfast even as the world spins into chaos around him.

---------------------------------------------

## THEMES:

Throughout the course of the series, there are three fundamental concepts that drive the story: the power of love, men’s struggle against death, and the relationship between Harry and his mentor Dumbledore. Each of these deserves thorough analysis.

-------------------

**1. LOVE**

One of the most recurring themes in the whole series is the sacrificial love of Harry’s mother Lily, who died to protect her infant son. Voldemort’s deadliest weapon, the “Killing Curse,” rebounded when he used it against Harry, shattering the Dark Lord’s power. In the final pages of Book 1, Voldemort cannot physically touch Harry due to the power of his mother’s love in him. Later in the series (after the Dark Lord’s return to power), Voldemort attempts to “possess” Harry but cannot due to the contrast between Harry’s soul and his own. Harry’s life is founded on his love for others, while Voldemort’s life is centered around hatred.

Headmaster Dumbledore observes at one point: *“That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to understand. Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped.”*

On a less complex level, love also repeatedly motivates acts of self-sacrifice on the parts of the main characters. Primary characters are willing to suffer unbelievable loss for one another, even giving up their lives in order to do the right thing. The love between family members is celebrated as beautiful and noble, never something to be mocked and sneered at.

However, the true significance of this theme does not emerge until Book 7.

Throughout the book, Harry, Ron and Hermione have successfully located and destroyed the six Horcruxes, magical objects bearing fragments of Voldemort’s essence. However, it soon becomes clear that, in fact, a seventh Horcrux exists: Harry Potter himself. The curse that originally failed to kill Harry struck Voldemort instead, blasting away a piece of Voldemort’s tainted essence…which in turn bonded to Harry. While Harry lives, Voldemort cannot truly die.

This theme of sacrificial love applies on the character of Severus Snape. As the Potions master at Hogwarts, Snape frequently appears to despise Harry throughout the series (although, interestingly, he often intervenes to protect Harry during the darkest moments). In the closing pages of Book 6, Snape appears to be allied with Voldemort, proving Harry’s longtime suspicions.

However, Book 7 finally provides the full story. Snape, a longtime admirer of Lily Potter, was forced to watch as she married a man Snape deemed reckless and immature. To make matters worse, Lily asked Snape to watch over their newborn son in the event of her death. Since that point, Snape’s relationship with Harry has been a constant source of pain…yet Snape chooses to sacrifice his own feelings and defend a child he believes should have been his. This plot is one of the most moving elements of the entire series.

----------------------------------

**2. DEATH**

According to Rowling, one of the major themes in the books is death. She once stated, *"My books are largely about death. They open with the death of Harry's parents. There is Voldemort's obsession with conquering death and his quest for immortality at any price, the goal of anyone with magic. I so understand why Voldemort wants to conquer death. We're all frightened of it."*

The whole series is constantly reminding us about the danger of desiring immortality. Voldemort is obsessed with the concept of living forever, no matter what the cost. This dark desire leads him down the path of villainy, transforming him from a disturbed orphan boy into the living reincarnation of evil. He attains a sort of half-immortality by constructing the Horcruxes – but in order to do so, he must take a human life for every Horcrux he creates. Dumbledore sharply critiques this empty attitude towards life: *“As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all – the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.”*

As the storyline progresses, it became more and more clearer that the only way to conqueor death is to longer fear it. For example, the story of the Peverell brothers who tried to cheat Death, and the objects which when reunited, would make one Master of Death, was not about achieving immortality but about accepting death. The only way someone can defeat death is when they no longer fear death, but accept it. They could then "greet Death as an old friend".

And in book one of the sorcerer's stone, Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel sacrificed the stone (and their lives) to protect it from Voldemort. And yet, they accepted it pleasantly, and agreed with Dumbledor that it's all for the best.

It's just like Dumbledore said: *"To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure."*



-------------------------------------------

**3. ACCEPTANCE & TOLERANCE**

A major recurrent theme in the book series is acceptance of others with different backgrounds, blood status, and beliefs from one's own. This theme is explored through the depiction of some pureblood wizards' disdain towards the Muggle-born wizards. The Malfoys symbolise intolerance and racism while the Weasleys are among the purebloods who completely accept people regardless of their background. This is further explored in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when the origin of the chamber is revealed. Among the four founders of Hogwarts, Salazar Slytherin was the only one to hold the ambition to purge the school from Muggle-borns, because he believed that they did not deserve to be taught magic. The other three founders turned against him and Hogwarts became a wizarding school accepting people of all blood status and backgrounds.

Voldemort himself is the ultimate example of intolerance and its disastrous effects on society, since he is known to "kill Muggles for fun". It is later revealed that his own father was a Muggle who left his dying mother and their unborn baby, which shows that often the foundations of racism lie in self-hatred and inability to accept oneself.

Another example of tolerance versus intolerance is the prejudice against werewolves and the consequences it can have on someone's job and marriage opportunities and mental health. The elves' slavery and the fight for their rights (started by Hermione Granger and S.P.E.W) is another example of the importance of equality.

Finally, a great message about tolerance can be given by Luna Lovegood, the odd and queer girl that is Harry's friend. Through her confidence and unapologetic insistence on her beliefs, she teaches us the importance of being unique and true to ourselves despite what others says.
