Backstory: The Fowl family is a family of criminals in Irish, and they're an extremely dangerous family at that. After Artemis Fowl I (the main character's father) disappears under mysterious circumstances though, the family becomes slightly less scary and slightly less rich—and Artemis Fowl II, a twelve-year-old genius with a talent for crime, has a plan to change all that.

Through a combination of Internet research and wild rumor, Artemis figures out that all of the children's stories and legends of magical creatures in different cultures refer to the same group of fairy folk (the People) who have been living secretly underground.

Main story: And each fairy has a Book——sort of a Bible—— that contains all of their magical secrets. What Artemis wants is the fairies' gold. So he blackmails a drunken fairy into giving him her Book,  and realizes the fairy gold in the legends is actually just a ransom fund for kidnapped People. Ah-ha.

Step Two is pretty obvious, Artemis with his bodyguard Butler kidnapped Captain Holly Short, a hotshot LEPrecon(Lower Elements Police Recon Department) officer when her magic is drained and was preforming a ritual to restore it. Holly's boss, Julius Root, goes on a rescue mission(and nearly died), Holly gets her powers back by finishing her ritual in her cell in Artemis' house, and Mulch Diggums—a dwarf—is sent in and distroyed Fowl's copy of The Book. Long story short, Artemis's plan goes crazy, the LEP put a Timestop on Fowl Manor(so it's isolated from the rest of the world)and sent in a wild Troll to scare them into giving up captain Holly Short. Butler is taken out by the Troll and almost dies, Holly heals him and Butler decapitated the Troll. After that the fairies decide to just give in the gold and "blue rinse"(a biobomb) the house, and take the gold back triumphantly when they were all dead. In classic Artemis fashion though, he figures out how to do what no one has ever done before, and escapes the Timestop and the biobomb—which, by a weird twist of fate, means the fairy rules declare him the winner and he keeps the gold	.
