Happy and joyful, carrying my camera and notepad, I set off to film my one-minute-Beijing video.

Walking through ancient sites and relics, I learned about old-Beijing folklores : In a sugar figurine shop in the summer palace, I found out the ancient history behind this near-extinct craft. I began to take an intense interest in this assignment. To match my dialogue in the video about technology and traffic, I went to subways and sky bridges voluntarily to film these shots.

During the filming, I caught a glimpse ancient folklore and traditions hidden in the alleyways in Beijing . The modern technology around us shows us that China is developing rapidly ,but we should never forget the valuable culture China still keeps.
