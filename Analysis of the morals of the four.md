## Analysis of the morals of the four (extremely boring) must-read books

1. holes

   Through a difficult story, Stanley finds out who his friends are and what the secret behind Camp Green Lake really is. The first life lessons of this story are that even though you make mistakes in your life, it's never too late to change them. Although Stanley is "at the wrong place at the wrong time" he always try to make the best of the situation. The second lesson is that friendship is very powerful. Stanley carried Zero up God's Thumb, by doing this he could have died, but Stanley had empathy for Zero so he went out after him. ,They are true friends.

2. where the mountain meets the moon

   ughhhh... This is my least favorite book of the four...

   I guess the main moral is generosity and compassion for other people, even those you don't know that well. She went out to find the old man of the moon to change their family's fortune, and when the time comes to ask the one and only question to the old man of the moon, she decides to ask her friend, dragon's question, instead of thinking only about herself.

3. hatchet

   The main theme of "Hatchet" is one of survival and independence. Stranded, Brian must learn to become self-reliant and learn by experience. And focusing his main attention on survival instead of their parents' recent divorce that occupy most of his mind. 

4. no talking

   I guess the main moral is one of those classic girl-boy book morals. boys and girls should get along together and learn to work together, only by that can you both improve and ... (quoting the politic textbook instinctively). No. I actually think that there's another moral altogether. That teachers shouldn't be so rigid and stiff and old-schooled all the time, it's good to have fun once in a while like the teachers in laketown elementary school.
